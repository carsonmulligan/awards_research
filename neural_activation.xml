    <ChartOne>
        <VisualCharacteristics>
            <HotSpot>Centered around a smaller red area</HotSpot>
            <Shape>Elongated but slightly narrower tail</Shape>
            <ColorGradient>Transitions from red (most intense) through yellow and green to blue (least intense)</ColorGradient>
        </VisualCharacteristics>
        <Interpretation>
            The main activation (red region) is compact, suggesting a concentrated zone of high neural response.
            The tail is narrower, indicating a more focused gradient of activation.
        </Interpretation>

    <ChartTwo>
        <VisualCharacteristics>
            <HotSpot>Red area is shifted and appears larger</HotSpot>
            <Shape>Elongated tail with a broader, more diffuse spread</Shape>
            <ColorGradient>Similar color scheme, but with a more pronounced yellow-green transition</ColorGradient>
        </VisualCharacteristics>
        <Interpretation>
            The larger red region suggests a higher or more widespread peak activation.
            The broader tail indicates a more dispersed or extended gradient of activation.
